# In general how to kill an expert
* You're dumb
* You're biased
* You didn't do it right

# Longfellow Cross
## You're dumb
* ASSOCIATE'S DEGREE (in Criminal Justice from Midlands Community College)
* Basic officer training at Midlands Police Academy in **1987**
* Is a detective
* Received additional training in criminal investigative techniques from FBI
* Retired since 2012

## You're biased
* 300/hr
* 60 hours + 0.5 for right now testifying
* Almost 20k (18k really)
* Always defense counsel retained (and in past it was on interrogation techniques, evidence of self-defense, bribery, and corruption, as well as crime scene investigation techniques

## You didn't do it right
* Not a proper audit, asked to evaluate it on its face based on your experience as an investigator

### Attacks validity of location pinpointing science
* Says it is invalid because a cell phone doesn't always connect to the closest tower (basically says proximity doesn't matter)
* Factors (distance, signal strength, and traffic)
* CDMA (single channel, code-division multiple access)
* GSM (global system for mobile communication) is other option (used a singular frequency as well, similar salting technology) Basically, 
* Says it is possible to chose not the closest tower because of, say, signal strength and traffic.
* "ping" doesn't mean we can pinpoint location.
* MOTHERFUCKING GPS

### Attacks validity of cell phone signal shifting
* "Is a blob" "always changing" "not possible to determine size or shape of a signal after the face"
* Um..... you can totally model that.
* Shape doesn't matter for pinpointing anyway
* Ping (time) pinpoints three towers = location
* Always connected to 3 anyway
* Can be 300 miles away?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!
* WTF WHAT KIND OF WATTAGE DO THESE PHONES HAVE
* Also area = area^2
* "Shape could have changed from day to day"
* If this was so true, we would see sweeping dropped calls from every single cell carrier. Even more so, if this was true, you would then imply that because we don't, there are an excess of cell towers that are so close that we have extremely powerful/accurate towers that can finally stand up to mother nature! Its not like we can speak to like fucking Jupiter or something like that.  Or connect to a comet. Because, you know, RF is so fucking volatile.
* SAYING THAT REMOVING ALL VARIABLES WHEN PERFORMING AN EXPERIMENT WASN'T ENOUGH. OH RIGHT, BECAUSE SCIENCE ISN'T A THING

### Attacks validity of Tender Wifi
* Smith removed all variables, performed the experiment with the Wifi, and that wasn't enough. Only once, sure, but still a valid data point! **Point to me where the variable would be.**
* Says it is possible that it would not connect until super close, or could even connect when super far away. **NEED TO IDENTIFY PROCESS IN SMITH** You collected no data yourself and have no experimental data
* **Fermi estimation**

### Lack of attacking GPS
* GPS is legit
