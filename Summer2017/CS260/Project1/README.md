# Project 1

## Timing Requirements

* First column should indicate the size of the data structure
* Remainig columns should report the measured times for the procedures that you apply

## Program 1: Lists

* Implement lists with arrays and pointers
* Create the following operations:
    1. FIRST
	2. END
	3. RETRIEVE
	4. LOCATE
	5. NEXT
	6. PREVIOUS
	7. INSERT
	8. DELETE
	9. MAKENULL

## Program 2: Stacks

* Implement stacks with arrays and pointers
* Create the following operations:
	1. TOP
	2. POP
	3. PUSH
	4. EMPTY
	5. MAKENULL

## Program 3: List Tests

* Test all functions
* Time (5 operations):
	1. Iterated insertion (in front, at the back)
	2. Traversal
	3. Iterated deletion (in front, at the back)
* Time the implementations of:
	1. A default library for lists
	2. Personal array lists
	3. Personal pointer lists

## Program 4: Stack Tests

* Test all functions
* Time:
	1. Iterated insertion (PUSH)
	2. Iterated deletion (POP)
* Time the implementations of:
	1. A default library for stacks
	2. Personal array stacks
	3. Personal pointer stacks

## Report

* Timing results
* Derive "conclusions"
