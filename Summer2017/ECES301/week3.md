# Week 3 Notes

## Complex Numbers
* $z=a+jb$ or $z=a+ib$
* $e^{j\theta}$ is 1 at any angle
* Positive angles go counter clockwise
* Negative angles go clockwise
* Polar phasor representation is great, simple as fuck

### Vector representation
* The spectrum is another way of looking at the signal, picture on slide 19
* Brush up on row reduced echelon form
* If a matrix is invertible, it is linearly independent
* We are going to use $\sin$ and $\cos$ as basis sets for other representations
* If your signal is not in that span, the basis set is not complete
* Errata marker signals (page 39)
* Can only represent $\sin$ as a vector if the components are harmonics (scalar multiples) of the original $\sin$
