# Calculation of Facebook Ratios

Using the above formulae and values, the following ratios were calculated:

* Current Ratio: 11.97. This shows that there are about 12 assets for every liability. This shows that Facebook has good short-term debt paying ability.
* Inventory Turnover: N/A. As Facebook does not have inventory that they run through, there is nothing to show here.
* Accounts Receivable Turnover: 8.44. This shows that the company is converting receivables into cash about 8 times a year.
* Days in Receivables: 43.25. On average it takes 43 days for Facebook to be paid for it's work.
* Total Debt to Total Equity: 0.10. This low value shows that there is a small amount of debt. This is good for an average creditor because it shows there is a buffer from equity to debt.
* Net Profit Margin: 0.37. This shows that Facebook is able to churn out a profit of 37% after all expenses are taken out.
* Return on Equity: 0.20. This shows that stockholders of Facebook are seeing a return on their investment.
* Earnings per Share: 9163.63. This shows how much was made per share of common stock. At such a high rate, Facebook should be content.

# Calculation of Chipotle Ratios

Using the above formulae and values, the following ratios were calculated:

* Current Ratio: 1.85. This shows that Chipotle has more assets than liabilities. This number is a little low and if it is declining, it may show that the financial condition is deteriorating. 
* Inventory Turnover: 236.19. Chipotle shows that it very frequently replaces inventory as more was sold. This shows that almost 9 times every two weeks Chipotle restocks.
* Accounts Receivable Turnover: 54.93. This shows that Chipotle is converting receivables into cash about 55 times a year. For Chipotle this happens a little under once a week.
* Days in Receivables: 6.64. On average, Chipotle is paid in under a week for it's work.
* Total Debt to Total Equity: 0.44. This low value shows that Chipotle has a small amount of debt (in comparison to equity.)
* Net Profit Margin: 0.01. This shows that Chipotle turns a 1% profit after expenses are taken out.
* Return on Equity: 0.01. This shows that the stockholders of Chipotle are seeing a return on their investment.
* Earnings per Share: 77.86. This shows how much was made per share of common stock. It is a respectable value for Chipotle.

# Total Debt to Total Equity Ratio Industry Standard

The industry average for Social Media is around 0.01. This means that Facebook has more debt than normal for a Social Media Company. In the restaurant industry, the average is around 0.03. This shows that Chipotle is also high on the amount of debt it has in comparison to the norm.

# Return on Equity Industry Standard

The industry average for restaurants is 48.95%. Chipotle has a 1% return on equity (assuming this was calculated correctly). This shows that they are behind on making stockholders more money. In the social media industry, the value is about 15.41%, Facebook is around 20%, a respectable value for the stockholders.

# Additional Required Information

Another important ratio to consider is the Average Sale Period. This shows how many days on average it takes to sell the inventory. This would benefit the analysis of, say, Chipotle, because fast turnaround is paramount in the restaurant industry. The important thing to recognize is that finances only show a portion of the picture. I could answer with something like Horizontal or Vertical Analysis to compliment Ratio Analysis, but that is not what I would value. I think reviewing the lives of the workers, their relationships with management, and their drive would give a solid boost of trust and validity to the numbers that simply more numbers could not provide.
