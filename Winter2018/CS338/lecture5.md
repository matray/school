# Midterm
* One question per covered topic
* Anything mentioned in class is fair game
* Hour and a half time to do the midterm
* If you don't understand the question, write down assumptions
* e.g. if a semicolon is missing, don't just say it won't compile, continue onward with what would happen
* Closed books, notes, phones, smart devices
* Final is cumulative and will be three hours long
* Not big on definitions questions
* Thinking questions, compare and contrast, short answer, long answer
