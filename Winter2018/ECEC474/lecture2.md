#Lecture 2
* Lecture 1 Overview covers everything nicely by the way
* Rule Area^2 is proportional to Power
* Starting from A Simple Processor Slide

Midterm Question:
What is a pin, where is it located, what does it do?
This is in context of cell-based design (or standard cells)

* Standard Cell - Example is a pretty interesting slide

Midterm Question: Hierarchical Design - 3 metals, not 4th metal (VLSI reference) (out of 7 possible layers)

Standard Cell Notes
C and Slew output capacative load and Slew

PLA Layout is freaking insane

Trench Transistors used in Memory production - Relation to Macro Modules SRAM slide

Soft Macro Modules are like APIs for Cells (normally because of IP issues)

Why don't we know timing acurately in PRe-Layout Semicustom design flow

Floorplanning v. Placement
Floorplanning - bigger blocks and their placement
Placement - More granular placement

Floorplanning is not necessary


# Prewired Arrays

Programmable Logic Style
* Array-Based is old style
* Look-up Table is new style

Programmable Interconnect STyle - Midterm Question - How we connect little pieces together

It's all about the minterms

Array-Based PRogrammable Logic - often will be only possible programmable because not all solutions needed

# LUT - Based Logic Cell

Xilinx 4000 Series

Competitor to LUT style is Array-BAsed Programmable Wiring

Midterm Question
Connections are Mesh-Based (Network) or Channel-routing (1 to 1)

Idea is that each line has a purpose (big network)

Altera Array Interrconnect Array BAsed v. Mesh BAsed
Array based with bus causes locking of resources
Mesh Based requires lots of resources
