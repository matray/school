# Lecture 3
* Still going over lecture notes 1.2
* Errors happen 1 in 10^5 up to 1 in 10^14

## Worked out example
* 3 KHz channel (regular telephone line)
* Bit rate = digital bandwidth = 3 KHz
* Channel capacity = above * 2 Kbps = 6 Kbps
* 4 level signal = channel cap * 2 = 12 Kbps
* 8 level signal = channel cap * 3 = 18 Kbps


## Random formula
* C = 2wlog_2(m)
* C = wlog_2(1+S/N)
* = 2wlog_2(sqrt(1+S/N))
* m = sqrt(1+S/N)
