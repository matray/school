* rdt 1.0 = perfect channel (no errors, no losses)
* rdt 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 = channels with error
* rdt 3.0 = channels with errors and losses
* Will wait for ACK in tcp
* Alternate send and ACK with 0 and 1 to make sure packets are actually sent as expected
* 3.0 includes a timeout, calculated round trip time plus like 50% and that is new timeout
