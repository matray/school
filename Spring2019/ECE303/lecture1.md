# General Notes - Intro
* Digital load means 1V not zero

# Linear Regression
* Data pair (x, y) is taken for series of data points
* Would be nice to estimate the line that best fits the data such that the equation is:
$$
y = a_1 x + a_0
$$
# Residual
* Let $y_n$ denote the measured dependent variable value based on the measured independent variable value $x_n$.
